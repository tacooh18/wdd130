                <h1>Monkeying Around Water Rafting</h1>

                    <p>
                        Folks often ask, when they book whitewater vacations, who else might be on the trip with them. Do we get a lot of families? (Yes, in the mid-summer months, when kids are out of school. 
                        whitewater rafting trips are one of the best family vacation destinations out there!) Will an ‚Äúold‚Äù person feel out of place? (Absolutely not, many of our passengers are retirees who always wanted to raft 
                        the Rivers but couldn‚Äôt find the time to get away until the kids were grown and gone.) Is it mostly going to be couples? Will it be mostly men, doing a guys‚Äô trip?
                        <br><br>
                        The truth is, we do see a lot of couples on our river rafting tours ‚Äî and I am using the term ‚Äúcouple‚Äù loosely. It might be a mother/daughter or father/son couple, a married couple, life partners, or a couple of good friends.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether you‚Äôre part of a group, a couple, or traveling solo, Monkeying Around Water Rafting fosters a unique opportunity to build family dynamics and interpersonal growth over and over again. 
                        Going on a trip alone also starts you off in the right mindset ‚Äî you‚Äôre already pushing yourself to try new things, just by booking the trip!
                        <br><br>
                        We are continually inspired by those who take control of their destinies and decide to have FUN ‚Äì even it means taking a trip of a lifetime on their own. This adventure will leave you with many memories but more importantly a river family.
                        <br><br>
                        To all the single ladies and fellas out there who are wondering whether they should book a seat for one on a Grand Canyon Whitewater rafting tour. The answer is an emphatic ‚ÄúYES!
